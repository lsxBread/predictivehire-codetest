# PredictiveHire Code Test 

This demo project is containing a GraphQL Server + REST API gateway with back-end microservices all written using the NestJS Framework and TypeScript

## Architecture Overview
 
The GraphQL server receives the requests from client side and fetch data by calling RESTful API, ultimately it will return aggregated data to client side. 

The REST API acts as a gateway/proxy for the different microservices it exposes.

The controllers of the REST API make calls to the servers/microservices in the back-end through [TCP](https://docs.nestjs.com/microservices/basics).

The Nestjs microservices then handles the request to connect to databases or any other service it needs to serve requests.

All the components(GraphQL, API Gateway, microservies) are dockerized and for simplicity purpose, these containers are all in bridge network, so that they are visible to outside through its service name.

### Design Patterns

This architecture implements the following Microservice Design Patterns:

1. [Microservice Architecture](https://microservices.io/patterns/microservices.html)
2. [Subdomain Decomposition](https://microservices.io/patterns/decomposition/decompose-by-subdomain.html)
3. [Externalized Configuration](https://microservices.io/patterns/externalized-configuration.html)
4. [Remote Procedure Invocation](https://microservices.io/patterns/communication-style/rpi.html)
5. [API Gateway](https://microservices.io/patterns/apigateway.html)
6. [Database per Service](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/database-per-service.html)

## Layers

### API Layer

[NestJS + Express](https://nestjs.com/) acts as the API Layer for the architecture. It takes care of listening for client requests and calling the appropriate back-end microservice to fulfill them.

### Microservice Layer

[gRPC](https://grpc.io/) was chosen as the framework to do the microservices. [Protocol buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) was used as the data interchange format between the client (REST API) and the server (gRPC microservices). NestJS is still the framework used to create the gRPC Microservices.

### Persistence Layer

PostgreSQL is used as the database and Sequelize is used as the Object-Relational Mapper (ORM).

## Deployment

Deployment is done with containers in mind. A Docker Compose file along with Dockerfiles for each project are given to run the whole thing on any machine. For production, it's always recommended to use [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) for these kinds of microservices architecture to deploy in production. [Istio](https://istio.io/) takes care of service discovery, distributed tracing and other observability requirements.

### Project Organization

1. `_proto` - This directory consists of all the gRPC Service Definitions/Protocol Buffers.

2. `api-gateway` - This directory consists of the API Gateway project. All code relating to the API Gateway resides here.

3. `docs` - This directory consists of all files relating to documentation. The OpenAPI Specification for the REST API and the gRPC Service Definitions/Protocol Buffers documentation can be found here.

4. `microservices` - This directory consists of all microservice projects.

5. `microservices/comments-svc` - This directory consists of all files/code relating to the Comments Microservice project.

6. `microservices/organizations-svc` - This directory consists of all files/code relating to the Organizations Microservice project.

7. `microservices/users-svc` - This directory consists of all files/code relating to the Users Microservice project.

8. `scripts` - This directory consists of shell scripts that automates building and running the whole project.

## How to Run

1. System Requirements - must be Linux/Mac
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - v12 Recommended
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) - latest
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) - latest

2. On the Terminal, go into the project's root folder (`cd /project/root/folder`) and execute `npm start`. The start script will install all npm dependencies for all projects, lint the code, compile the code, build the artifacts (Docker images) and run them via `docker-compose`.

3. Once the start script is done, the API Gateway will listening on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

4. To test the API, head to the Swagger UI running at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:3000)
